# Spell Speeds and Monster Effect Types

## Monster Effect Types

The game has the following monster effect types:

### Continuous effects

> [!NOTE]
> **Does not create a Chain Link**

These are effects that start applying immediately once the monster is successfully summoned 
("successfully" = its summon was not negated, otherwise it was successfully summoned, even if it 
was immediately destroyed).

### Trigger effects

> [!NOTE]
> **Creates a Chain Link**

These are Spell Speed 1 effects that happen when a specific condition is met (they "trigger"). 
They can be either *mandatory* or *optional* (You can tell when an effect is optional if it includes 
the words "You can"). Flip Effects are a special kind of Trigger Effect. Trigger effects _can_ 
activate during the non-turn player's turn, depending on the trigger condition of the card.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
>Trigger effects [can miss timing](./Missing%20Timing.md)

### Ignition effects

> [!NOTE]
> **Creates a Chain Link**

These are Spell Speed 1 effects that the turn player can choose to activate (think of it as 
"turning the ignition" of a car) during their Main Phase. 

### Quick effects

> [!NOTE]
> **Creates a Chain Link**

These are Spell Speed 2 effects that are very similar to ignition effects with the exception that 
they can be activated whenever a Spell Speed 2 effect can be activated. (AFAIK, in GOAT format only 
Kuriboh has a Quick Effect) 

## Spell/Trap Effect Types

Much like monster effects, Spell/Trap effects can also be split into the following effect types:

* Continuous effects
* Trigger-like effects
* Ignition-like effects
* Quick-like effects

Same things apply, as monster effects.


## Spell Speeds

The term "Spell Speed" describes when you can activate certain cards or effects.

### Spell Speed 1

* Includes normal Spells and Trigger and Ignition effects. 
* Spell Speed 1 effects can only start a chain and they cannot be chained to Spell Speed 2 and Spell Speed 3 effects.
* If 2 or more Spell Speed 1 effects happen simultaneously then they do chain with each other in the following order (also known as "**SEGOC**" - Simultaneous Effects Go On Chain):
  1. **Turn player's mandatory effects first**. If there's more than 1 the turn player chooses the order.
  2. **Non-turn player's mandatory effects**. If there's more than 1 the non-turn player chooses the order.
  3. **Turn player's optional effects**. If there's more than 1 the turn player chooses the order.
  4. **Non-turn player's optional effects**. If there's more than 1 the non-turn player chooses the order.
