# Effect Types

## Monster Effect Types

The game has the following Monster effect types:

### Continuous effects

> [!NOTE]
> **Does not create a Chain Link**

These are effects that start applying immediately once the monster is successfully summoned 
("successfully" means its summon was not negated, otherwise it was successfully summoned, even if it 
was immediately destroyed).

### Trigger effects

> [!NOTE]
> **Creates a Chain Link**

These are [Spell Speed 1](./Spell%20Speeds.md) effects that activate when a specific condition is met (they "trigger"). 
They can be either *mandatory* or *optional* (You can tell when an effect is optional if it includes 
the words "You can"). Flip Effects are a special kind of Trigger Effect. Trigger effects _can_ 
activate during the non-turn player's turn, depending on the trigger condition of the card.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
>Some Trigger effects [can miss timing](./Missing%20Timing.md)

### Ignition effects

> [!NOTE]
> **Creates a Chain Link**

These are[Spell Speed 1](./Spell%20Speeds.md) effects that the turn player can choose to activate (think of it as 
"turning the ignition" of a car) during their Main Phase. 

### Quick effects

> [!NOTE]
> **Creates a Chain Link**

These are [Spell Speed 2](./Spell%20Speeds.md) effects that are very similar to ignition effects with the exception that 
they can be activated whenever a Spell Speed 2 effect can be activated. (AFAIK, in GOAT format only 
Kuriboh has a Quick Effect) 

## Spell/Trap Effect Types

Much like Monster effects, Spell/Trap effects also have effect types, pretty much equivalent to these of Monster effect types:

* **Continuous effects** - Found in Continuous Spell/Trap cards, Field Spell cards and Equip Spell cards
* **Trigger-like effects** - Found in Continuous Spell/Trap cards
* **Ignition-like effects** - Found in Continuous Spell cards
* **Quick-like effects** - Found mostly in Trap cards

Same things apply, as in Monster effects types.
