# Costs, Activations and Targeting

* Costs are always paid the moment a card is activated. If the card tells you to pay, discard, Tribute, or destroy in the activation text (before the semicolon), it’s a cost.
* Since costs happen on activation, if player A activates a card that requires a Monster tribute on the field as cost, player B cannot then activate cards or effects that would target the tributed monster on the field, since that monster has already moved to the GY.
* Any activation conditions (written before the colon) only have to be met when you activate the card. If something changes before the card resolves, and the conditions aren’t met anymore, it doesn’t matter. (Any conditions that STILL have to be true when the effect resolves will be listed separately.)
* A colon or semicolon on a monster, or on a Continuous Spell/Trap, means a chain starts. (Remember that activating a Spell or Trap Card starts a chain, too.)
* For any card that targets, if the effect text (after the semicolon) still refers to a ‘target’/‘that target’, you have to double-check that any targeting requirements are still met.
Otherwise, if the card refers to the target using any other word (like ‘it’) in the effect text, the targeting requirements only had to be met when the target was originally targeted.
