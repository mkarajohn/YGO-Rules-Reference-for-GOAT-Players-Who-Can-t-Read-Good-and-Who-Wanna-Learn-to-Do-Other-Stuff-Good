# Chains

Certain actions in the game create (or add to) what is called a "Chain".

>[!NOTE]
> A Chain is a stack (LIFO stack, if you are a programmer :P) of card _activations_ ("Chain Links). 
> The actual card effects _will resolve_ (apply) in reverse order, once both players stop adding Chain Links to that Chain.

## Actions that start a Chain

Starting a Chain is another way to say that an action becomes Chain Link 1.

* Activating Spell/Trap cards
* Activating Monster/Spell/Trap card effects

Once one of these actions has initiated a Chain both players can continue adding more actions that 
contribute to the Chain (Chain Links)

## Actions that do not start a Chain

* Summoning a Monster on its own and not by other card effects (e.g. Monster Reborn)
* Setting a Monster
* Setting Spell/Trap cards
* Change battle position of a Monster
* Declaring an attack
* Changing turn Phases

>[!NOTE]
> While none of the above actions start a chain, players _can start_ a chain as a response to one 
> of the above actions happening
