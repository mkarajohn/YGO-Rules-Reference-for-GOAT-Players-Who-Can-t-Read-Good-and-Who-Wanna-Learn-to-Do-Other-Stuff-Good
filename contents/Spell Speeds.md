# Spell Speeds

The term "Spell Speed" describes when you can activate certain cards or effects. 
There are 3 tiers of Spell Speeds in the game:

### Spell Speed 1

Includes Normal, Continuous, Equip, Field and Ritual Spell cards, [Trigger](./Effect%20Types.md) and [Ignition](./Effect%20Types.md) Monster effects, Trigger-like and Ignition-like Spell/Trap effects.

* Spell Speed 1 effects can only start a Chain and they cannot be chained to Spell Speed 2 and Spell Speed 3 effects.
* If 2 or more Spell Speed 1 effects happen simultaneously then they do chain with each other in the following order (also known as "**SEGOC**" - Simultaneous Effects Go On Chain):
  1. **Turn player's mandatory effects first**. If there's more than 1 the turn player chooses the order.
  2. **Non-turn player's mandatory effects**. If there's more than 1 the non-turn player chooses the order.
  3. **Turn player's optional effects**. If there's more than 1 the turn player chooses the order.
  4. **Non-turn player's optional effects**. If there's more than 1 the non-turn player chooses the order.

> [!WARNING]
>In Goat Format, simultaneous effects work exactly as stated above, with one additional caveat: 
> when two effects were triggered at different times, the earlier trigger(s) must be placed on the 
> Chain before the later ones. So in other words, if two mandatory effects are triggered in sequence, 
> whether as part of a Chain resolution or through some other action, you will construct the 
> resulting Chain by going through the "steps" above for each "time" an effect(s) was triggered. 
> Because of specific rule quirks governing the activation of optional trigger effects (missing the timing), 
> this will basically only ever come up in “steps” 1 and 2. 
>
>Example 1: Player A tributes their Sangan to Tribute Summon Thestalos the Firestorm Monarch. 
> In the resulting Chain, Sangan’s mandatory Trigger Effect will be Chain Link 1, and Thestalos’s 
> mandatory Trigger Effect will be Chain Link 2.
>
>Example 2: Player A activates Soul Exchange, targeting Player B’s Sangan. Player A Tributes Player B’s 
> Sangan to Tribute Summon Thestalos the Firestorm Monarch. In the resulting Chain, Sangan’s mandatory 
> Trigger Effect will be Chain Link 1, and Thestalos’s mandatory Trigger Effect will be Chain Link 2.

### Spell Speed 2
