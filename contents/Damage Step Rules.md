>[!IMPORTANT]
> In current Yu-Gi-Oh!, an unlimited number of Chains can be activated during the Damage Step, in 
> the "before damage calculation" window. In Goat Format, **only one Chain can occur during each substep of the Damage Step** 
> (unless the resolution of one Chain triggers some other effect).
> 
> e.g. The attacking player activates Limiter Removal during the "**Before Damage Calculation**" 
> sub-step of their Damage step. The other player responds with Magic Jammer. If the Chain ends there
> and Limiter Removal gets negated the attacking player cannot activate any more Limiter Removal cards 
> during "**Before Damage Calculation**" and since Limiter Removal cannot be activated during 
> "**Damage Calculation**" they completely lose their chance in increasing their Monsters' attack
