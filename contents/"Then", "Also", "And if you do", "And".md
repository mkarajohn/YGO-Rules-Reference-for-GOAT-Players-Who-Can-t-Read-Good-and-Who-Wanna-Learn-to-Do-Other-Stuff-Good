# "Then", "Also", "And if you do", "And"


## Then (Do A, then do B)

**Timeline**

B happens after A, even though they’re part of one card effect. These things happen in sequence, not simultaneously.

**Causation**

A is required for B, but NOT vice-versa. If A does not happen, then stop. If B cannot happen, you still do A.

e.g. if Cyber Jar flips face up and Torrential Tribute is chained to its effect, by the time Cyber Jar's 
effect resolves there are no Monsters on the field to destroy and since its effect reads "_Destroy all monsters on the field, then ..._"
the "then" part of the effect cannot happen.


## Also (Do A, also do B)

**Timeline** 

Considered simultaneous. Both happen at the same time.

**Causation** 

Neither is required for the other. Just do as much as you can!

## And if you do (Do A, and if you do, do B)

**Timeline**

Considered simultaneous. Both happen at the same time.

**Causation**

A is required for B, but NOT vice-versa. If A does not happen, then stop. If B cannot happen, you still do A.

Basically, this phrase acts like “also” & “and” for Timeline purposes, but acts like “then” for Causation purposes.

## And (Do A and B)

**Timeline**

Considered simultaneous. Both happen at the same time.

**Causation**

BOTH are required. If you cannot do both, then you do nothing.
